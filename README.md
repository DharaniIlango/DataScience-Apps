# 10 Web Applications with Streamlit and Python

Welcome to the **10 Web Applications with Streamlit and Python** repository! This project serves as a refreshment of my programming and data science application knowledge. Over the course of this journey, I will build 10 unique web applications using **Streamlit** and **Python**, documenting every step of the process here.

These applications are inspired by resources from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Data Professor](https://www.youtube.com/c/DataProfessor), as I aim to learn, explore, and experiment with various tools and techniques used in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **web development**.

## Applications Overview

Here is a list of the 10 web applications I will be building:

1. **Simple Stock Price** - An app to display and compare the stock prices using an API.
2. **Simple Bioinformatics DNA Count** - A bioinformatics app to count nucleotides in a DNA sequence.
3. **EDA Basketball** - Exploratory data analysis on basketball data.
4. **EDA Football** - Exploratory data analysis on football data.
5. **EDA SP500 Stock Price** - Analyze SP500 stock price data with EDA.
6. **EDA Cryptocurrency** - Perform EDA on cryptocurrency price data.
7. **Classification Iris** - A machine learning classification app using the famous Iris dataset.
8. **Classification Penguins** - Classification on Penguins dataset using machine learning.
9. **Regression Boston Housing** - Build a regression model to predict housing prices in Boston.
10. **Regression Bioinformatics Solubility** - A regression app for predicting solubility in bioinformatics.

_Each app will have its own directory within this repository with a detailed description of the problem it solves, the features implemented, and instructions on how to run it._

## Installation

To run any of the web apps locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DharaniIlango/DataScience-Apps
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

   ```bash
   cd streamlit-webapps
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   # For MacOS:
   source env/bin/activate
   # For Windows:
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_name.py
   ```
   Replace app_name.py with the corresponding app's Python file.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: For the core logic of the web applications.
- **Streamlit**: To build and deploy interactive web apps.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning model building (used in specific apps).
- **Plotly/Matplotlib**: For data visualization in some apps.

## Learning Resources

These applications are based on tutorials and inspiration from:

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Data Professor](https://www.youtube.com/c/DataProfessor)
